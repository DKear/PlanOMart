# PlanOMart
The PlanOMart program is designed to assist customers while grocery shopping. The customer could type in a key word
for the product they are trying to find and the program will return possible matches and a description of each possible match. 
The main use of the program is to locate where in the store the item is, but it also provides details including price for each item. 

The program also features an admin side where a manager could login and edit the store's layout, 
change item details, or change item availabilities.
